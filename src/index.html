        <h2>between tradition and modernity in late colonial India</h2>

            <blockquote><p>Palmyr Cordier, a French colonial doctor stationed in Chandernagor and Pondicherry, commissioned hundreds of Sanskrit manuscripts, mainly on medical topics, from different institutions across India between 1898 and 1904. This collection, now housed at the national library of France, presents a unique opportunity to study and compare scribal practices in the colonies and princely states of Alwar, Benares, Bengal, Bikaner, Bombay, Kashmir, Madras, &amp; Tanjore, all produced within the same span of six years. In addition, Cordier’s meticulous notes and correspondence presents a window into the process of commissioning, producing, and shipping manuscripts. Rather than being mechanical copyists, many of the people employed by Cordier played active roles in editing and collating the texts; some of them were Āyurvedic experts. Looking at their choices of script, material, format, and language, we find a distinct north-south divide in their attitude towards the usage of Sanskrit as well as their adoption of new techniques and technologies.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Palmyr Cordier, a.k.a. Śrī Naukavirāja Rajjukāra</h2>
        <section>
            <p>By the end of the 19th century, the British Empire had gained control over most of the Indian subcontinent, but France still held on to a number of colonies in the region. In the heat and humidity of the tropics, the French were assailed by infectious diseases and parasites that had never before been experienced in Europe, and it was in this context that the French colonial medical corps was founded, in 1890. During times of war, these medical officers were essential for the treatment of soldiers, but in times of relative calm, they also took up the task of caring for the medical needs of the colonial inhabitants (Héraut 2006, 386). Palmyr Uldéric Alexis Cordier (1871–1914) was one of the students of the very first class of the school for naval and colonial medicine, the Santé Navale in Bordeaux, where he completed a doctoral thesis on Indian medicine (Cordier 1894).</p>
            <p><label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-rajjukara"></label><input id="mn-rajjukara" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="ex-libris.jpg" alt="Cordier's ex-libris stamp">Cordier's ex-libris stamp, from the cover of Sanscrit 1242.</span>Cordier had, naturally, been hoping to be posted to India, but instead he was sent to serve in Senegal and then to Madagascar. But he continued his study of Sanskrit as well as Tibetan; in fact, he made connections with the Indian community in Madagascar, and, through them, was able to procure some books from Bombay (Roşu 1990, lxxi). Finally, in 1898, he obtained a post in Chandernagor, a French colony in Bengal, near Calcutta. While working at the hospital there, he continued his research on Indian medicine, getting to know the local community of traditional physicians, many who bore the title of kavirāja, <q>king of poets,</q> which may refer to their familiarity with Sanskrit medical texts (Gupta 1976, 368). Some of these physicians were noted scholars themselves: Umeśacandra Gupta Kavirāja, for example, had recently published a comprehensive lexicon of Indian medical terminology (1894). Eventually, Cordier came to style himself as a kavirāja as well — on the cover of Sanscrit 1242, dated 1899, an ex-libris stamp bears the name and title <em>śrī naukavirājaḥ ḍa pa rajjukāraḥ,</em> <q>naval physician D[octor] P. Cord-maker,</q> giving a literal Sanskrit translation of his surname.

        <h2>Mailing, copying, and photographing manuscripts</h2>
        <section>
        <p>Many of the manuscripts that Cordier had copied came from the Asiatic Society in Calcutta — then the capital of British India —, just an hour away from Chandernagor.<label for="sn-sanscrit1186" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-sanscrit1186" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Sanscrit 1186, a printed pothi from Sri Venkateswar Press in Bombay, dated <em>saṃvat 1952, śake 1817</em> (1895/96 CE), may have been obtained in this way.</span> But he also had manuscripts mailed from other cities to be copied in Chandernagor. In an elaborate colophon to Sanscrit 1177, composed in anuṣṭubh ślokas and drafted three times, Umeśacandra Gupta writes that, in Chandernagor, he copied a manuscript that had been brought there from Bikaner (<em>samānītaṃ bikānīra-rājapustakasadmanaḥ</em>).<label for="sn-sanscrit1177" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-sanscrit1177" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Sanscrit 1177, <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b100905830/f159">156</a>–<a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b100905830/f160">157</a>.</span> There were also a number of old and rare Nepalese manuscripts at the Asiatic Society that had been acquired by Haraprasāda Śāstrī from his recent trips to Kathmandu, and for these, Cordier first photographed them before having transcriptions made from the photographs (Li 2022). In the case of the <em>Kāśyapasaṃhitā</em>, he even stacked the photographs and pierced a stringhole through them, binding them together like a palm-leaf manuscript.<label for="sn-wujastyk1998" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-wujastyk1998" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The palm-leaf manuscript itself now seems to be lost (Wujastyk 1998, 207).</span></p>

Since he did not stay long enough in each city to procure copies of everything that he wanted, he seems to have ordered copies to be produced and then mailed to him. <!--label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-sanscrit1170"></label><input id="mn-sanscrit1170" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="sanscrit1170.jpg" alt="Brown paper packaging with colonial Indian postage stamps">Packaging found with Sanscrit 1170.</span-->Traces of these mailings can still be found in the collection: in Sanscrit 1170, tucked inside one of its doubled folios, there are scraps of brown paper packaging with a colonial Indian postage stamp, addressed to <q>Dr P. Cordier medecin des Colonies (French) Chandernagar Bengal</q>. Sanscrit 1255 comes with a mailing label from Ānandāśrama, addressed from Harinarayan Apte, the superintendent at the time, to Cordier’s home in Besançon, France. <!--label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-sanscrit1169"></label><input id="mn-sanscrit1169" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="sanscrit1169.jpg" alt="Note at the end of Sanscrit 1169a"/>Note at the end of Sanscrit 1169a.</span-->Longer manuscripts or large orders of manuscripts were mailed in stages — in Sanscrit 1169, from Raghunath Temple in Kashmir, a note at the end of the first part reads, <q>I have sent you two hundred and fifty Shloks, and will send you by and by</q>. <!--label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-sanscrit1266"></label><input id="mn-sanscrit1266" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="sanscrit1266.jpg" alt="Letter found with Sanscrit 1266"/>Letter found with Sanscrit 1266.</span-->In some cases, manuscripts were not copied at the repository itself, but sent to a scriptorium — manuscripts from Raghunath Temple were sent to Sri Ranbir Library to be copied; manuscripts from Deccan College were copied at Ānandāśrama.</p>
        <p>Most of what we know about this collection comes from a long article published in Le Muśeon, based on a presentation that Cordier made at the Congrès des Orientalistes in Hanoi in 1902;<label for="sn-hanoi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-hanoi" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The presentation was given on the morning of 6 December 1902 (Cordier 1903, 61).</span> but, given the dates in the manuscript colophons, we know that he continued to receive manuscripts from India for a couple years afterwards. Unfortunately, he did not publish on the collection again; at the beginning of the First World War, he was drafted as part of the 5ième régiment d’infanterie coloniale, taken prisoner in Alsace,<label for="sn-alsace" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-alsace" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><q>Les docteurs Cordier, de Shaken, Franck et Mury sont restés aux mains de l’ennemi à l’ambulance de Walsheid, où ils donnent leurs soins aux nombreux blessés</q> (Bourdet 1920, 11).</span> and died shortly after being released, in September 1914. His official cause of death was <q>maladie contractée aux colonies avant guerre,</q> with the mention, <q>Non Mort pour la France</q> (Ministère des armées).</p>

        <h2>Scope and overview of the collection</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Cordier’s manuscript collection resurfaced in 1932, when Jean Filliozat happened to recognize it at an antiquarian shop in Paris. He petitioned the Bibliothèque nationale de France to purchase the whole lot, and it is is preserved there now, split between the Chinois, Indien, Sanscrit, and Tibétain collections. This present study concerns the Sanskrit medical manuscripts, which comprise 194 items from Sanscrit 1148 to Sanscrit 1332 (some shelfmarks contain multiple manuscripts). 10 of these are either prints, photographs, or older manuscripts that Cordier purchased; for example, Sanscrit 1180 was previously owned by Rāma Hari Pāla Kavirāja, and Sanscrit 1187 by Kavirāja Kāliprasanna Dās Gupta, both of Chandernagor. The remaining 184 were commissioned by Cordier and produced between 1898 and 1904, based on the dates given in the manuscripts themselves.<label for="sn-themselves" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-themselves" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This excludes colophons that were copied from an antigraph. Some of the manuscripts mentioned by Cordier in his article do not seem to be extant in the present collection (Roşu 1990, civ).</span> The earliest date seen in the collection is 31 October 1898, written by Cordier on the back of Sanscrit 1190, and is presumably the date on which the manuscript was received. The latest date is found in the colophon to Sanscrit 1325, corresponding to 3 January 1904.</p>

            <p>The figure above shows these 184 manuscripts, their place of copy, their approximate size<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-size"></label><input id="sn-size" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Manuscripts were measured either directly or, if they were already microfilmed, by using the digital images of a folio bearing a library stamp, which measures 22 mm in diameter.

 and shape, and the names of scribes, editors, and procurers related to each manuscript. In many cases, Cordier did not contract directly with a scribe but with an authority figure who organized the copying of manuscripts and then sent them to Cordier; in this study, these people are grouped under the term <q>procurer.</q> Their names are usually noted by Cordier himself, on a title card accompanying the manuscript, with the formula <q>copié par les soins de....</q></p>

            <h2 id="paper">Paper types and formats</h2>
            <p>All 184 are paper manuscripts, but the quality and format of the paper differs significantly from region to region. Across the Gangetic plain, in north India, the manuscripts are predominantly produced in the traditional, horizontal pothi format, while in south India, they are almost invariably vertically-oriented codices. In fact, the south Indian manuscripts use industrially-made British paper, sized to a standard foolscap folio, and in Tanjore, these pages are folded in half to form a booklet. In Madras, a local bookbinder has even been employed (Sanscrit 1252 &amp; 1253). These divergent choices show a striking divide between north and south Indian attitudes toward the tradition of manuscript-making at the turn of the century. In this period, a wide variety of book and manuscript formats are in circulation, and there are even some inventive, hybrid formats — Sanscrit 1232, a lithograph of the <em>Vṛttaratnāvalīcandrikā</em>, is printed horizontally, but it is paginated like a book and collated in sections of two bifolia. The choice to produce a manuscript in pothi format, in the same style as the centuries-old manuscripts that were being copied, seems to be a deliberate act on the part of the scribe or institution to reproduce a tradition that had already long been eroded by both Mughal and European influence.</p>
            <figure><div id="fig-size"></div></figure> 
            <p>The format of a manuscript is also intimately related to the way in which it was read. As Cordier observed, the reading of a pothi was a ritual act: the reader, generally a brāhmaṇa, would sit in an ascetic pose, place the manuscript on his knees, and begin by reading the namaskāra out loud with hands clasped together, then continue to recite the text in a singing voice. The reader may already know the text by heart; the pothi seems to act more as a memory aid.<label for="sn-aid" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-aid" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><q>A-t-on besoin de consulter un pothi..., le médecin, qui est généralement de caste brahmanique, accroupi sur son tréteau, à la manière d’un ascète, déroule gravement le plaque et place le livre sur ses genoux. A la première page, lisant les salutations du début <q>Ōm namo gaṇēçāya....</q> il porte à son front les deux mains étendues + réunies (namaskāra), puis commence à lire d’une voix chantante, mettant en relief les visarga. D’ailleurs il sait par coeur à peu près tout le contenu de ses pothis</q> (letter to Liétard of 29 November 1898, 9).</span></p>
            <p>A variety of paper types is also seen in the collection, ranging from handmade paper to laid paper produced in British as well as Indian mills.<label for="sn-mills" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-mills" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There is also one case of paper produced in Fiume, Croatia (Sanscrit 1192).</span> Handmade paper was already in decline in the 19th century, due to the export of the raw materials used to make it (Ramaseshan 1989, 115). Nevertheless, in this collection, the manuscripts produced in both Bikaner and Kashmir are almost entirely written on handmade paper. The paper used in Kashmir is especially distinctive — it is thin, glossy, very white and translucent, qualities that were attributed specifically to Kashmiri paper already in the 15th century (Ghori &amp; Rahman 1966, 135-137). The sheets are also cut to much larger sizes compared to pothi manuscripts in other parts of India, and they are often doubled; in fact, they may simply be sheets that were produced for making vertically-oriented codices, but rotated 90 degrees to approximate a pothi.</p>
