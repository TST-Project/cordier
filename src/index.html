        <h2>between tradition and modernity in late colonial India</h2>

            <blockquote><p>Palmyr Cordier, a French colonial doctor stationed in Chandernagor and Pondicherry, commissioned hundreds of Sanskrit manuscripts from different institutions across India between 1898 and 1904. This collection, now housed at the national library of France, presents a unique opportunity to study and compare scribal practices in the colonies and princely states of Alwar, Benares, Bengal, Bikaner, Bombay, Kashmir, Madras, &amp; Tanjore, all produced within the same span of six years. In addition, Cordier’s meticulous notes and correspondence presents a window into the process of commissioning, producing, and shipping manuscripts. Rather than being mechanical copyists, many of the people employed by Cordier played active roles in editing and collating the texts, shaping the early knowledge of Āyurveda in Europe. Looking at their notes, their letters, and their choices of material and format, we find a distinct north-south divide in their attitude towards the usage of Sanskrit as well as their adoption of new techniques and technologies.</p></blockquote>

        <section>
            <p>Although, by the end of the 19th century, the British Empire had gained control over most of the Indian subcontinent, France still held on to a number of colonies in the region. In the heat and humidity of the tropics, the French were assailed by infectious diseases and parasites that had never before been experienced in Europe, and it was in this context that the French colonial medical corps was founded, in 1890. During times of war, these medical officers were essential for the treatment of soldiers, but in times of relative calm, they also took up the task of caring for the medical needs of the colonial inhabitants (Héraut 2006, 386). Palmyr Uldéric Alexis Cordier (1871–1914) was one of the students of the very first class of the school for naval and colonial medicine, the Santé Navale in Bordeaux, where he completed a doctoral thesis on Indian medicine (Cordier 1894).</p>
            <p>Cordier had, naturally, been hoping to be posted to India, but instead he was sent to serve in Senegal and then to Madagascar. But he continued his study of Sanskrit as well as Tibetan; in fact, he made connections with the Indian community in Madagascar, and, through them, was able to procure some books from Bombay (Roşu 1990, lxxi). Finally, in 1898, he obtained a post in Chandernagor, a French colony in Bengal, near Calcutta. While working at the hospital there, he continued his research on Indian medicine, getting to know the local community of traditional physicians, many who bore the title of kavirāja, <q>king of poets,</q> which may refer to their familiarity with Sanskrit medical texts (Gupta 1976, 368). Some of these physicians were noted scholars themselves: Umeśacandra Gupta Kavirāja, for example, had recently published a comprehensive lexicon of Indian medical terminology (1894). Eventually, Cordier came to style himself as a kavirāja as well — on the cover of Sanscrit 1242, dated 1899, an ex-libris stamp bears the name and title <em>śrī naukavirājaḥ ḍa pa rajjukāraḥ,</em> <q>naval physician D[octor] P. Cord-maker,</q> giving a literal Sanskrit translation of his surname (fig. 1).</p>
